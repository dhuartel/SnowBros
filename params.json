To go from win or lose screens to start screen we have to press Enter. In game the player is moved with A(Left) and D(Right), to jump we use L and to shoot or push J.\r\n\r\nTo win this game we have to defeat all enemies in both levels. To defeat them, we can turn them into snowballs by shooting at them and then pushing them(pressing the shoot button in contact with them), making the ball roll and then be destroyed or we can make another ball roll over them making them fly, if we destroy them this way, they may drop a power-up, that we can collect.\r\n\r\nYou lose when all your lives are lost, you lose a live each time you touch an enemy or a enemy shot.\r\n\r\nPower-Ups: \r\n-Red: Doubles our speed \r\n-Yellow: Doubles the speed of our shots \r\n-Blue: Doubles the power of our shoots\r\n\r\n###Author\r\nDaniel Huarte\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have any doubt/comment, you can contact me at: dhuartel@gmail.com\r\n",
