How to play:

To insert a coin we have to press space in the start screen,
and to start the game we have to press Enter once we have at least one coin.
To go from win or lose screens to start screen we have to press Enter.
In game the player is moved with A(Left) and D(Right), to jump we use L and to shoot or push J.

To win this game we have to defeat all enemies in both levels. 
To defeat them, we can turn them into snowballs by shooting at them 
and then pushing them(pressing the shoot button in contact with them), making the ball roll and then be destroyed
or we can make another ball roll over them making them fly,
if we destroy them this way, they may drop a power-up, that we can collect.

You lose when all your lives are lost, you lose a live each time you touch an enemy or a enemy shot.

Power-Ups:
-Red: Doubles our speed
-Yellow: Doubles the speed of our shots
-Blue: Doubles the power of our shoots
